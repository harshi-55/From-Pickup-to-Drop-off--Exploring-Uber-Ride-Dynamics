# From-Pickup-to-Drop-off--Exploring-Uber-Ride-Dynamics
This project delves into a dataset of Uber rides, examining key attributes such as start and end dates, ride categories, pickup and drop-off locations, miles traveled, and trip purposes. The analysis seeks to identify trends in rider behavior, including peak usage times and popular routes, as well as assess trip efficiency through distance and duration metrics. By employing exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, the project aims to provide actionable insights that can inform operational strategies, optimize service delivery, and enhance the overall customer experience in the ride-hailing industry.<br/>
